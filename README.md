# Diff Checker

A simple and intuitive diff checker application built with Python and Streamlit. Compare two texts side-by-side and visualize the differences between them.

## Features

- 🎯 Two input fields for comparing texts
- 📊 Unified diff output format
- 🎨 Side-by-side HTML diff visualization with color coding
- 📈 Diff statistics (line counts, difference count)
- 💻 Clean and modern UI

## Installation

This project uses `uv` for package management. Make sure you have `uv` installed.

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
uv run streamlit run main.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser. You can:

1. Enter your first text in the "Text 1" field
2. Enter your second text in the "Text 2" field
3. Click the "Compare" button to see the differences

## Output Formats

The application provides two diff visualization options:

1. **Unified Diff**: Standard unified diff format showing additions and deletions
2. **Side-by-Side HTML Diff**: Visual HTML diff with color-coded changes (green for additions, red for deletions)

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.13
- Streamlit >= 1.28.0

## Deployment

### Streamlit Community Cloud (Recommended)

Streamlit Community Cloud is the easiest way to deploy this application for free. **Note:** GitHub Pages cannot host Streamlit apps as it only serves static files, while Streamlit requires a Python server.

#### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository and branch
   - Set the main file path to `main.py`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Your app will be live at:** `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

The `requirements.txt` file is already included for Streamlit Cloud to install dependencies.

### Alternative Deployment Options

If you prefer other platforms:

- **Render**: Add a `render.yaml` or use their web service
- **Railway**: Connect your GitHub repo and deploy
- **Heroku**: Use a `Procfile` with `web: streamlit run main.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0`
- **Fly.io**: Use their platform with Docker or their Python buildpack
